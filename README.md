◆ Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagrams: Detailed visual representations of entities, relationships, and attributes to define the database schema.

◆ Database Normalization: Optimization of database structures to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

◆ SQL Queries: Execution of queries to create, manage, and manipulate data within the database, including CRUD operations and advanced joins.

◆ Database Population: Insertion of meaningful sample data for testing and demonstration purposes.

◆ Data Extraction from Files: Importing data from external files into MySQL and performing SQL queries to analyze the extracted data.
